/*\
 * Scheduler test that uses a football analogy.
 *
 * The premise is that we want to make sure that lower priority threads
 * don't run while we have runnable higher priority threads.
 * The offense is trying to increment the balls position, while the
 * defense is trying to block that from happening.
 * And the ref (highest priority thread) will blow the wistle if the
 * ball moves. Finally, we have crazy fans (higer prority) that try to
 * distract the defense by occasionally running onto the field.
 *
 * [Algorithm]
 *
 * - Create NR_CPU offense threads (lower priority).
 * - Create NR_CPU defense threads (mid priority).
 * - Create 2*NR_CPU fan threads (high priority).
 * - Create a referee thread (highest priority).
 * - Once everyone is on the field, the offense thread spins incrementing
 *   the value of 'the_ball'. The defense thread tries to block 'the_ball'
 *   by never letting the offense players get the CPU (it just spins).
 *   The crazy fans sleep a bit, then jump the rail and run across the
 *   field, disrupting the players on the field.
 * - The refree threads wakes up regularly to check if the game is over :).
 * - If the value of 'the_ball' is > 0, the test is considered to have failed.
